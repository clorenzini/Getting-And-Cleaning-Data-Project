Getting-And-Cleaning-Data-Project
=================================

## This is the ReadMe file for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

###The code should run as written

It reads in the data at the beginning

Then it translates some variable to their true meaning

Then it combines our test and trainign sets

Then it pulls only the variables we want to deal with

Then it creates a new name for the variables

Then it finds the mean of each of those variables based on activity

Then it creates a tidy dataset
